Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Labs: Self-Scheduled, Several hours / week expected

Prerequisites
-------------

Knowledge of classical control at the level of 2.14/2.010 or equivalent is assumed. Familiarity with linear algebra at the level of 18.06 is assumed. Exposure to modern control theory at the level of 2.151 is assumed.

Textbook
--------

The course text is: Franklin, Gene F., J. David Powell, and Michael L. Workman. _Digital Control of Dynamic Systems_. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1997. ISBN: 9780201820546.

Laboratory Assignments
----------------------

You will have approximately five laboratory projects in which you will explore topics such as sampling effects and digital filters, design and implementation of digital controllers for servomechanisms, state variable control and estimators, and modeling of plants using system identification techniques. You will do these labs individually. The labs finish with a 20 minute interview with a teaching assistant in the lab. The results of this checkoff (as expressed by your understanding of the lab subject matter and experimental results) will count 30% towards the lab grade. Each person will turn in a lab report, due at the time of the checkoff. Since it is essential that all your data and conclusions are available at the time of your checkoff, late lab reports will not generally be accepted.

Problem Sets
------------

These will be assigned on a regular basis, and are essential for understanding the class material. Cooperation among class members is permitted on the homework. It is important however that what you turn in accurately reflects your true understanding of the material.

Computation
-----------

We will be using MATLAB® and Simulink® on both MIT servers and on the lab PCs, to support both the problem sets and the lab assignments.

Grading
-------

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Problem Sets | 20% |
| Laboratory Assignments | 20% |
| Two Quizzes | 25% |
| Final | 35% 

Late problem sets will not be accepted. The quizzes and final are closed-book. However, in the exams, one or two crib sheets will be permitted. The two quizzes will be held in-class during Lec #12 and Lec #21. The final exam will occur during the regular final examination period, as scheduled by the registrar. The final will be 3 hours in length.
