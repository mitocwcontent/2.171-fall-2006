Students will complete approximately four laboratory projects in which you will explore topics such as sampling effects and digital filters, design and implementation of digital controllers for servomechanisms, state variable control and estimators, and modeling of plants using system identification techniques. Students will do these labs individually.

The labs finish with a 20 minute interview with a teaching assistant in the lab. The results of this checkoff (as expressed by one's understanding of the lab subject matter and experimental results) will count 30% towards the lab grade.

For each lab assignment, each student will turn in a lab report, due at the time of the checkoff. Since it is essential that all data and conclusions are available at the time of your checkoff, late lab reports will not generally be accepted.
